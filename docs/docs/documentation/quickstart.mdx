# Getting Started
<!-- **Last updated: Dec 20, 2025** -->

## Overview
LUML is an open-source cloud-agnostic AIOps platform. It covers the full ML project lifecycle, covering experiment tracking, model versioning, one-click model deployment, and post-deployment monitoring.

If you are new to the platform, the quickest way to get started is to first create a model using the auto-ML module (Express Tasks). You can then use this trained model to explore more advanced functionalities. Please follow the guide below to train the model just in several clicks:

1) Navigate to the [main page of the platform](https://app.luml.ai/).
2) Choose an available task, for example ***Tabular Classification***.
3) Select the built-in ***Sample Dataset*** for model training.
4) Once selected, you can check out the uploaded file and make any changes if needed. Click ***Train***.
5) Upon completion, you will see a dashboard with the model's performance metrics.
6) You can download the model (in an [open-source format](./Core-Concepts/dfs_model.md))  by clicking the Export button.

Congratulations! You have successfully trained your first model on the LUML platform. While this is the simplest method to obtain a trained model (we also support more advanced workflows via [Notebooks](./Modules/notebooks.md) and [Python SDK](../sdk/client.md)), it is the quickest way to get ready for exploring further modules, such as the [model registry](../documentation/Modules/Registry/Model-Registry/) and [model deployments](./Modules/deployment.md).
