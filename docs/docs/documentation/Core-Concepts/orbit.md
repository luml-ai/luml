# Orbit
An Orbit is a project space within an Organization that brings work together without owning the heavy resources itself. The name comes from the way it operates: the Orbit is the center of a project, while the data storage ([Buckets](./bucket.md)) and compute resources ([Satellites](./satellites.md)) stay outside and are linked in as needed, similar to objects moving around a central body.
