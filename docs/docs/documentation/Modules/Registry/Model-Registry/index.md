# Model Registry
Selecting a specific object in the Registry opens the Model Registry interface. This is the control panel for a specific artifact (model), providing access to detailed information and analysis tools.
The LUML Model Registry is a centralized hub for organizing and tracking machine learning models throughout their lifecycle. It stores models, including the experiment run that generated them, and maintains a history of their versions. Users can annotate models with description and assign tags to support downstream workflows. This makes collaboration, governance, and model evolution easier to manage across teams.

## Model Overview
The Overview tab acts as the technical passport of the object. It contains a structured dictionary of static metadata describing the model’s origin and characteristics. This includes:
- General Information - model name, creation date, file size.
- Manifest - a technical description of the .luml model contents.
- Tags - service metadata that adds searchable context to models for easier organization and workflow support.
