# Attachments
The Attachments are the files produced during model training and evaluation that are saved alongside an experiment run. The module imposes no restrictions on the type or extension of attached files. These can range from model weights to configuration files, audio samples, or even project documentation.

For seamless interaction, a File Viewer is integrated into the Registry interface. It enables immediate in-browser preview of commonly used file formats without requiring downloads. Supported formats include media content such as images (.jpeg, .png, .svg), audio recordings (.mp3), and video files (.mp4). The viewer also handles data and structural files including tabular data (.csv), configuration files, and scripts (.json, .xml, .txt), as well as documents such as PDF reports (.pdf) and web pages (.html). 

Files in other formats (e.g., binary data or proprietary extensions) or files over 15MB remain available for download to a local device.
