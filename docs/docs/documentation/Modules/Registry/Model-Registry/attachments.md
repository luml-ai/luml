# Attachments
The Attachments are the files produced during model training and evaluation that are saved alongside an experiment run. The module imposes no restrictions on the type or extension of attached files. These can range from model weights to configuration files, audio samples, or even project documentation.

For seamless interaction, a File Viewer is integrated into the Registry interface. It enables immediate in-browser preview of commonly used file formats without requiring downloads, including:
- Media Content  
Images (.jpeg, .png, .svg), audio recordings (.mp3), and video files (.mp4).

- Data & Structures  
Tabular data (.csv), configuration files, and scripts (.json, .xml, .txt).

- Documents  
PDF reports (.pdf) and web pages (.html).

Files of any other specific formats (e.g., binary data or proprietary extensions) or files over 15MB remain always available for download to a local device.
